# About Project
Automatic Search is a python application that uses web scrapring to extract links referring to Google Scholar search, prioritizing pdf files. A spreadsheet in xlsx format is automatically created, organizing the links in columns according to the researched themes. In other words, Automatic Search is a facilitator for academic research.

## The Application

In the menu, you can type "1" to perform a new search ("0" to finish).
